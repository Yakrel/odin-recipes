    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ingredients for Chef John's Honey-Glazed Ham</li>
      <li>Roasting pan with rack</li>
      <li>Instant-read thermometer</li>
      <li>Optional: Kitchen torch</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        Pour water, star anise, and cloves into the bottom of a roasting pan.
        Place a roasting rack on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ham on the rack. Cut 1/4-inch deep slashes 1/2-inch apart
        lengthwise and crosswise across the top of the entire ham.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake ham in preheated oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, whisk together the
        glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush glaze over the ham, repeating every 20 minutes until the glaze is
        golden-brown and the internal temperature reads 130 degrees F (the
        temperature will continue to rise for a little while after its out of
        the oven).
      </li>
      <li>
        For a caramelized finish, either broil the ham for a few additional
        minutes, or remove from the oven and use a kitchen torch to heat the
        glaze until caramelized, about 2 to 5 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
